## Intro(?)
HELLO!

PLEASE call me Sebastian when I use this, I am slowly trying to figure out how to use this site.
Pronouns are he/they and I *will* use it/its if I *allow* someone.

This is a profile I made for me, myself, and I alone.
I did this to feel more comfortable in my body whenever I didn't exactly feel like "myself"; nor want to be referred to as such.

I also find myself getting easily aggrivated, so I tend to avoid people who I recognize even slightly<sub>as i can only remember names mostly</sub>
UNLESS I see them as a safe person to be around in this state. 

__<sub>Do I Need To Mimick Myself To Stop You From Questioning?</sub>__

BTWBTWBTW if i interact w u i probably think ur cool but it might take a little to consider u a friend so keep that in mind ^^,

but they say it came out of a small thing.
Lately, I'm feeling like a big bang
'cause I've been making something out of nothing_

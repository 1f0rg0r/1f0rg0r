## Small Intro(?)
HELLO!

PLEASE call me Sebastian when I use this, I am slowly trying to figure out how to use this site.
Pronouns are he/they and I *will* use it/its if I *allow* someone.

This is a profile I made for me, myself, and I alone.
I did this to feel more comfortable in my body whenever I didn't exactly feel like myself; nor want to be referred to as such
<sub>probably not a sys, js brain dmg</sub>.

I also find myself getting easily aggrivated, so I tend to avoid people who I recognize even slightly<sub>as i can only remember names mostly</sub>
UNLESS I see them as a safe person to be around in this state.

BTWBTWBTW if i interact w u i probably think ur cool but it might take a little to consider u a friend so keep that in mind ^^,

To people I don't know?
Is it something that you learn
When constantly alone?
When did I become a man
Trapped inside a ghost?❞_

## Small Intro(?)
HELLO!

PLEASE call me Sebastian when I use this, I am slowly trying to figure out how to use this site.
Pronouns are he/they and I *will* use it/its if I *allow* someone.

This is a profile I made for me, myself, and I alone.
I did this to feel more comfortable in my body whenever I didn't exactly feel like myself; nor want to be referred to as such
<sub>not a sys, probably js brain dmg</sub>.

I also find myself getting easily aggrivated, so I tend to avoid people who I recognize even slightly<sub>as i can only remember names mostly</sub>
UNLESS I see them as a safe person to be around in this state.


> _❝So you quote love unquote me
Well, stranger things have come to be
But let's agree to disagree
'Cause I don't believe you❞_
